The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is located in the world-renowned destination for art -- New York City. Nowadys, the Museumâ€™s  collection contains almost 200,000 works from the world including painting, architecture, design, film,  and performance art. One of my favourate piece of Vincent van Gogh: The Starry Night is exhibited in MoMa.





###  Goal: 
Help the visitors find the artists they are interested (sort by country).


###  How:
When the visitor enter the MoMa, they can find the artists or artwork they are interested in from their touch device apps in the art gallery, which makes the museum visits more interactive and immersive.

The following words will be shown from MoMa's touch device app: 

"Hello! Welcome to New York City and welcome to the Museum of Modern Art! This is one of the greates art galleries in the world. Before stepping into MoMA, which country's artists are you intereted in?"
