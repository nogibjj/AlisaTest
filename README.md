Nowadys, the Museumâ€™s  collection contains almost 200,000 works from the world including painting, architecture, design, film,  and performance art. One of my favourate piece of Vincent van Gogh: The Starry Night is exhibited in MoMa.


##Goal: 
Help the visitors find the artists they are interested (sort by country).


##How:
